    "# 3.2 Velocity-based motion model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this chapter we will describe two probabilistic motion models for planar movement: the **velocity motion model** and the **odometry motion model**, the former being the main topic of this section. Remember that when a movement command is given to a robot, there are different factors that affect such movement (*e.g.* wheel slippage, unequal floor, inaccurate calibration, motors response, etc.), adding uncertainty to the actual move done. This results in a need for characterizing the robot motion in *probabilistic terms*, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_t | u_t, x_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "being:\n",
    "- $x_t$ the robot pose at time instant $t$,\n",
    "- $u_t$ the motion command (also called control action) at $t$, and\n",
    "- $x_{t-1}$ the robot pose at the previous time instant $t-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically this probability models the probability distribution over robot poses when executing the motion command $u_t$, having the robot the previous pose $x_{t-1}$. In other words, we are considering a function $g(\\cdot)$ that performs $x_t=g(x_{t-1},u_t)$ and outputs $x_t \\sim p(x_t | u_t, x_{t-1})$. $\\\\[10pt]$\n",
