    "# 3.3. Odometry-based motion model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Odometry** can be defined as the sum of wheel encoder pulses (see Fig. 1) to compute the robot pose. In this way, most robot bases/platforms provide some form of *odometry information*, a measurement of how much the robot has moved in reality. It is fun to know that cdometry comes from the Greek words ὁδός [odos] (route) and μέτρον [metron] (measurement), which mean *measurement of the route*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Such information is yielded by the firmware of the robotic base, which computes it at very high rate (*e.g.* at 100Hz) considering constant linear $v_t$ and angular $w_t$ velocities. Concretely, if we know the total number of markers $n_{total}$ (empty holes in the mask)  the encoder has, the angle that the wheel turns per marker can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha=\\frac{2\\pi}{n_{total}} \\, \\, \\text{(radians)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This angle increment is detected each time a pulse occurs. Then, in a given time interval $\\Delta t$, the total angle rotated by the wheel given the number of pulses detected $n_t$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "As commented, the firmware of the robotic base computes these pose increments at a very high rate, and makes it available to the robot at lower rate (*e.g.* 10Hz) using a tool that we already know: the composition of poses:\n",
