    "## Robotic Sensors Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beacons\n",
    "   - **GPS (Global Positioning System)**: GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location and time information, crucial for robots that require localization outdoors. However, it has limitations in indoor environments or locations with poor satellite coverage (e.g., dense urban areas). Typically, GPS data is used in conjunction with other sensors to enhance localization accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Range Sensors\n",
    "   - **Sonar**: Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) uses sound waves to detect the distance to objects. It’s effective for obstacle avoidance and distance measurement but has limitations in spatial resolution and can struggle with reflective surfaces.\n",
    "   - **Infrared (IR)**: Infrared sensors emit infrared light and measure the reflection to calculate distances. They are commonly used for proximity detection and are inexpensive, though they can be sensitive to environmental light and have limited range.\n",
    "   - **Laser Scanner (LIDAR)**: LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors use laser light to create highly accurate distance measurements by measuring the time it takes for a laser to bounce back after hitting an object. LIDARs provide high-resolution spatial data, useful in mapping and navigation, though they can be costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cameras\n",
    "   - **Standard Cameras**: These cameras capture 2D images and can be used for object recognition, tracking, and environmental monitoring. Paired with image processing algorithms, they can support tasks like visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. RGB-D Cameras\n",
    "   - **RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, Depth) Cameras**: These cameras capture color (RGB) data as well as depth information, which allows for 3D mapping and object detection. Common examples include the Microsoft Kinect. RGB-D cameras are useful in applications where depth perception is critical, such as gesture recognition and indoor navigation.\n"

    "## Scan observation models\n",
    "\n",
    "Scan observation models are used when the sensor mounted on the robot provides a scan measuring distance and angle to obstacles in the workspace, *e.g.* a laser range finder. In this case, each element in the map is a cell described by its position (and probably a color representing if its free of obstacles or occupied), and data association is not explicitly addressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Beam model\n",
    "The beam model estimates the probability of a scan by considering the likelihood of individual beams in a scan based on expected measurements. It is based on the ray-casting principle, where each beam (or ray) from the sensor interacts with the environment, determining the distance to an obstacle or its absence. By accounting for sensor noise, unexpected obstacles, and measurement failures, this model offers a realistic and robust way to interpret scan data.\n",
